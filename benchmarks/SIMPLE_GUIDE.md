# CBFtorch Benchmarking - Simple Guide

## ✅ **Clean Organization Complete!**

### 📁 **What to Use (Only 2 Files!)**

```
benchmarks/
├── benchmark.py              # ← RUN THIS to measure performance
├── analyze.py               # ← RUN THIS to view results  
├── results/                 # ← Data gets saved here automatically
└── [everything else]        # ← Framework code (ignore)
```

### 🚀 **Commands You Need**

```bash
# 1. Measure performance
python benchmarks/benchmark.py

# 2. View results  
python benchmarks/analyze.py

# 3. Compare before/after optimization
python benchmarks/analyze.py --compare before.json after.json
```

### 🎯 **What Gets Measured**

✅ **All critical optimization targets covered:**
- Gradient computation redundancy (47.6% potential savings)
- HOCBF evaluation overhead (1310% slower than basic barriers)  
- Multiple barriers scaling
- Memory usage patterns
- Batch processing efficiency

### 📊 **Sample Results**

```
PERFORMANCE METRICS:
Average barrier evaluation: 26μs
Average HOCBF evaluation: 361μs  
Average Lie derivatives: 1112μs
HOCBF overhead: 1310%

OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES:
Gradient inefficiency: 1.94x
Potential time savings: 47.6%
```

### 🔧 **Optimization Workflow**

1. **Baseline**: `python benchmarks/benchmark.py` 
2. **Optimize**: Make your code changes
3. **Re-test**: `python benchmarks/benchmark.py`
4. **Compare**: `python benchmarks/analyze.py --compare baseline.json optimized.json`

## ✨ **Why This is Better**

**Before**: 8+ confusing scripts doing overlapping things
**Now**: 2 simple scripts that do everything you need

**Before**: Results scattered in different formats  
**Now**: All results in `benchmarks/results/` with consistent naming

**Before**: Unclear what to run
**Now**: Run `benchmark.py` → Run `analyze.py` → Done!

## 🎉 **Ready for Optimization!**

You now have a **clean, simple benchmarking system** that:
- ✅ Measures all critical performance bottlenecks
- ✅ Saves comprehensive data for comparison  
- ✅ Provides clear analysis and visualization
- ✅ Uses only 2 simple commands

**Focus on optimization, not benchmark complexity!**
